		<li>I have nearly 3000 hours in CS:GO, I have also played in two ESEA open seasons and was the IGL for two teams, I still suck.</li>
		<li>I do not own a car.</li>
		<li>I grew up raising herd animals, some noteable breeds were the Norwegian Fjord, a very calm and tame horse known for their long manes and 'stunning' beauty, and the Irish Dexter, a cow.</li>
